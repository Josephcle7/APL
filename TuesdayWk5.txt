Dependent Types:
  Languages can be broken down into two different parts
    -Terms
      int type;
      char y;
      a = a + 1;
      if (x){ y }
      else { c };
    -Type
      list a;
      T a;
  
  There is a coorespondance between types and logic expressions
    -A x B
      A and B
    -A + B
      A or B
      
  Godels incompleteness theorem
    -There is no language that is expressive enough to express everything that is true in the language
  
  Induction
    -data int = z is int
